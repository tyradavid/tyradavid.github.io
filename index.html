							<p>
								I am a third-year student completing my Bachelor of Commerce at McGill University’s Desautels Faculty of Management. With specializations in Business Analytics and Information Systems, my skillset includes analytical tools, statistical analysis, data visualization, database management, and more recently, machine learning (R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel).  
							</p>
							<p>I believe in an interdisciplinary approach of combining technical skills and my love for technology to solve problems and generate recommendations. The future involves no longer relying on intuition, but instead, using big data and machine learning for predictive purposes. Analytics gives us the leverage to understand the world, solve pressing problems, and ultimately improve the world, through data!
							</p>
							<p> Five years ago, I began working as a lifeguard, after having a passion for swimming since I was a child. I was driven to go further and challenge myself, and developed a desire to share my knowledge with others while perfecting my skills. I am now implicated with the Lifesaving and teach and certify candidates as a National Lifeguard, in CPR and first aid. 
							</p>
							<p>I am also passionate about music and have been playing the clarinet for nine years now. I started off in my high school Honour Band and Jazz Band, and then started playing for McGill’s Symphonic Band Club. Recently, due to the global pandemic, I got involved with the Virtual Concert Band, a virtual band that unites musicians of all skill-levels, ages, and from all countries to share their passion for music.
